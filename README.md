This project demonstrates the application of linear regression to predict diabetes progression, highlighting the steps from data loading and preprocessing to model building,
evaluation, and visualization. The results indicate a moderate level of prediction accuracy, which could be further improved with more sophisticated models or additional data 
preprocessing techniques.

Dataset: The Diabetes dataset consists of 442 samples with 10 features related to patients' medical data and one target variable indicating the progression of diabetes.

Objective: The goal is to predict the progression of diabetes one year after baseline based on the given medical features.

Linear Regression Model: A linear regression model was built using the training data. The model finds the best-fit line that minimizes the mean squared error between the actual
and predicted values.

Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) score. An MSE of 2989.53 and an R² score of 0.54 indicate that
the model explains approximately 54% of the variance in the diabetes progression.

Visualization: Scatter plots were created to compare the actual and predicted values. A fitted regression line was added to the plot to visualize the model's fit.
